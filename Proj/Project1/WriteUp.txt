Electronic Menu
  Many restaurants today are busy, so waiters are slow in taking customerâ€™s orders. 
To reduce this problem, I decide to create a program using Visual Studio that can help the employees. 
This program will provide a menu to the customers and take their orders without needing the waiters. 
It fasten the process of ordering food and beverages. This project is called electronic menu.
  This program utilizes STL library including maps, sets, stacks, queues, iterators, and algorithms. 
Maps are used to store the name and price of the food. Sets are used to calculate the subtotal costs. 
Stacks are used to restart the order process. Queues are used to store the users order. 
Iterators are used to print out the menu. And algorithms are used to sort the menu. 
The program is divided into two sections: menu mode and order mode. 
  In the menu mode, the program will display an actual restaurant menu for the users. 
It lists food along with the prices. 
Users can also look up the ingredients on the description of the food they would like to know.
  In the order mode, users are able to choose items they would like to order from the mini menu. 
The procedure starts from ordering the beverages, food, and then desserts in this particular order. 
Once they finished the ordering procedure, the program will then prompt the users if their orders are correct, 
and if yes (type y) the program will automatically calculate the total price including the taxes. 
If no (type n), the users can change their orders and rerun the same procedures of the order mode again.
